Yesterday I got up at 8:30 in the morning. After I made some coffee, I got dressed and went to the bank because I had to pay the rent. The bank is only a couple blocks away, so I got there in a few minutes. There wasn’t a long line when I got in, so I paid the rent and left.
Afterwards I went to the butcher’s to get some meat. I also stopped at the market to get some tomatoes. I wanted to make pasta. When I got home I wrote a couple of emails. 
After a while I started getting hungry, so I decided to get to work on lunch. I put the tomatoes in a pot to cook with the meat, and I put some water on to boil.
After a while the water got hot and I put in the pasta. I cooked it for a few minutes and then sat down to eat.
After lunch, I drank some more coffee and then got ready for work. It takes me about 20 minutes to get to work from where I live. 
I was at work for a few hours, on Fridays I only give 2 classes.
I got off work at 8:30 and went to my girlfriend’s house. We went to drink a beer in her neighborhood. I was getting very hungry, so when I got home I made some fried eggs. After that I did some reading and went to sleep.
